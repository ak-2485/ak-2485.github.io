I am  a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. My research lies at the intersection of formal methods, numerical analysis, and scientific computing. I am advised by [David Bindel](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/), and funded by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

### Recently
+ Fall 2021
  - I have been invited to attend the [2021 ASCR Workshop on Cybersecurity and Privacy for Scientific Computing Ecosystems](https://web.cvent.com/event/f9a6d32d-f34c-43e5-980b-54f79ad848bc/summary) based on a position paper, *Formal Methods-based Certification Frameworks for Scientific Computing Applications*, that I wrote with my colleagues at Sandia National Labs. 
  - My work with Silke Glas, Misha Padidar, and David Bindel on [Global Stochastic Optimization of Stellarator Coil Configurations
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07464) is in submission.
  - I am joining the Digital Foundations & Mathematics Department at Sandia National Labs as a year round intern.
  - I have a new paper on a [machine-checked direct proof of the Steiner-Lehmus theorem](https://github.com/ak-2485/ak-2485.github.io/blob/master/Steiner_Lehmus_Theorem-1.pdf) in submission.
+ Summer 2021
  - I completed a summer practicum in the Digital Foundations & Mathematics Department at Sandia National Lab, where I worked on verification frameworks for time integration schemes in Coq. 
+ Summer 2020
  - I am attending the [Joint PPPL-Simons Summer School on Stellarator Optimization](https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/summer-school/summer-school-2020/overview).
  - I am teaching [CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SU20/class/CS/1110) at Cornell.
+ Spring 2020
  - I've been awarded the [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and will begin my doctoral studies at Cornell in the fall of 2020.
