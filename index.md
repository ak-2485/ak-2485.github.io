I am  a PhD student and Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow working under the supervision of [David Bindel](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University.

My research interests are in scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and formal methods. [I also like plasma physics](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel//blurbs/stellarator.html). 

### Recently

+ Fall 2020
  - I will be working with the formal methods group at Sandia National Lab (CA) for summer 2021 to develop formal frameworks for error analysis of HPC numerical algorithms. 
+ Summer 2020
  - I am attending the [Joint PPPL-Simons Summer School on Stellarator Optimization](https://hiddensymmetries.princeton.edu/summer-school/summer-school-2020/overview).
  - I am teaching [CS 1110: Introduction to Computing Using Python](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/SU20/class/CS/1110) at Cornell.
+ Spring 2020
  - I've been awarded the [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and will begin my doctoral studies at Cornell in the fall of 2020.
