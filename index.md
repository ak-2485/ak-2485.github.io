I am finishing my PhD in computer science at Cornell in fall 2024! I'll be joining the Digital Foundations & Mathematics Department at Sandia National Laboratories as a postdoctoral researcher in December of 2024. 

I design foundational tools with rigorous guarantees that make it convenient for programmers to reason about numerical accuracy and correctness.  As part of the [VeriNum](https://verinum.org/) research group, I maintain the [VCFloat](https://github.com/VeriNum/vcfloat) and [LAProof](https://github.com/VeriNum/LAProof) libraries for the [Coq Proof Assistant](https://coq.inria.fr/).

During my PhD, I was co-advised by [David Bindel (Cornell)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) and [Andrew Appel (Princeton)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/). I was supported by the [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). 

I can be reached by email at [ak2485@cornell.edu](mailto:ak2485@cornell.edu).
