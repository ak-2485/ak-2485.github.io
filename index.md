I am  a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, and a Computational Science Graduate Fellow with the Department of Energy. 

My research interests are in scientific computing, numerical linear algebra, and formal methods. [I also like plasma physics(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel//blurbs/stellarator.html).
