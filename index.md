I am  a second-year PhD student and Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow working under the supervision of [David Bindel](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/) in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University. My research lies at the intersection of formal methods, numerical analysis, and scientific computing.
